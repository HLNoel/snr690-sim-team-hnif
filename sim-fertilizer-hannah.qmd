In this simulation, the research questions is whether there is a difference in yield based on the variety of wheat grown. The response variable is the yield of the wheat. In this experiment, there are five wheat varieties that are being tested. To account for variation between fields, four blocks were used with random plots assigned to each block. These blocks are used because if you only test within one field, the model and data only show you the effects of wheat variety on yield within that one spatial location. The blocks make the data more "generalized".

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #calling tidyverse 

set.seed(123) #setting seed for reproducibility 

# Define experimental structure
varieties <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
blocks <- c("Block1", "Block2", "Block3", "Block4") #this is setting up the simulated data (verieties and blocks) 

# Define the truth
baseline_yield <- 3000  # kg/ha for variety A in block 1

variety_effects <- c(
  A = 0,
  B = 200,
  C = 350,
  D = 100,
  E = -50
)  #how variety effects yield 

block_effects <- c(
  Block1 = 0,
  Block2 = 150,
  Block3 = -100,
  Block4 = 200
)
  #random effects of blocks 
noise_sd <- 120

# Create all combinations of variety and block (full factorial design)
wheat_data <- expand.grid(
  variety = varieties,
  block = blocks
) #simulate the random block design 

# Add true yield based on variety and block effects
wheat_data <- wheat_data %>% #making the data frame 
  mutate(
    variety_effect = variety_effects[variety],
    block_effect = block_effects[block],
    true_yield = baseline_yield + variety_effect + block_effect,
    yield = true_yield + rnorm(n(), mean = 0, sd = noise_sd)
  )

# Look at the data
head(wheat_data)
